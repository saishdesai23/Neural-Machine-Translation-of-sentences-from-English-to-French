# Neural Machine Translation of sentences from English to French

In this project we have conducted a literature survey to study different model architectures used for implementing the task of Neural Machine Translation. Using this research, we have implemented this Machine Translation at sentence level using the following deep learning architectures - 

1) RNN with Bahadanu attention

Following translation tasks have been implemented using the mentioned architectures -  

1) English to French

2) English to German

**Instruction to run the code**

1) Clone the repository and unzip the folder
